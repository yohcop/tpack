A simple tool to pack a set of textures in a directory into a single
texture.

Current algorithm is quite dumb, and just attempt at making something
that works, as opposed to something optimal.

Compile
=======
GOPATH=`pwd` go install tpack

Usage
=====
running `bin/tpack -h` should give some documentation, but just in
case, there are several params:
-d : the directory containing individual images
-p : Padding to add between images in pixels. Default to 0px.
-s : Size of the output image - will be square of size s.
-t : template file to use when outputing the configuration.
     A sample one for css is in src/tpack/out.css.tpl
-o : output image. must be a .png.
-c : output config file

Sample:
bin/tpack \
    -d <path to the directory containing sprites> \
    -t src/tpack/out.css.tpl \
    -p 1 \
    -s 256 \
    -o <output image>.png \
    -c <output config file>
